<p>
A card game contains one or more card decks of 52 cards each.
</p>
<p>
Each deck contains four suits: Clubs &clubs;,
Diamonds <font color="red">&diams;</font>,
Hearts <font color="red">&hearts;</font>, and Spades &spades;.

Each suit contains thirteen card types with the following ascending
order: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King.

card at a time.
</p>
<p>
<b id="waste">Waste</b><br>
A pile where discarded cards are stored, usually so that these may be
used later in the game.
</p>
<p>
<b id="foundation">Foundation</b><br>
A pile of cards that is built upon a base card, usually in an
ascending sequence of the same card suit.
</p>
<p>
<b id="tableau">Tableau</b><br>
A temporary working pile where you build groups of cards in some
sequence before you are able to move the cards to a foundation.
</p>
<p>
<b id="build">Build</b><br>
