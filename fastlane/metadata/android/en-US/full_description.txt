SolitaireCG is an adaptation of Ken Magic's "Solitaire" for devices with few hardware buttons.

Changes against the original Ken Magic solitaire-for-android fix bugs, add games and portrait mode, and enable card dealing and playability in spider.  New hi-res graphics have been added to the original card graphics to take advantage of today's larger, higher resolution screens.

See <a href="https://solitairecg.sourceforge.io/news.php">News</a> for changes against the original code, and project updates.
